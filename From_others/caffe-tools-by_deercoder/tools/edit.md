Multi-line Edit in Vim
====

In command mode, press `Command + V` to end **multi-line edit** mode.

Select blocks using arrow, so that we could choose to edit them

Then do some deleting, some insertion or other operations.

If we want to insert, press `I` to enter insert, then insert, first it will appear in one line, but after that press `Esc`, then it will appear in multiple lines.
